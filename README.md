A single C header files containing functions with different bit twiddling hacks and a short explanation.
I've put them together for myself as a cheatsheet and to play around with them.
If you know any hacks not included, just submit a PR, or if you encounter any wrong stuff or a typo!

Short hack assortment:
* Number multiplication, division
* Even, odd and power checks
* Uppercase, lowercase
* Set, clear and flip bits
* Insert and extract bitfields into words
* Convert LSL, MSB, trailing bits
* Masked copy
* Bit swap
* Population count
* Bit island count
* Bit scans
* Lexiocographic permutations
* Swapping without temporaries
* Size comparison: min() and max() functions without branching
* Modular additions
* Power rounding
* Significant masking
* Logbase2 of power2 calculation using deBruijin sequence
* Fast inverse sqrt
* Bit reversion
* Masked color operations
* XOR en/decryption
* Branchless assignments
